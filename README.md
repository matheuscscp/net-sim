I've always wanted to write some code that simulates networking devices/agents/applications. I guess you leave college but college does not leave you.

# Roadmap

## Proof of Concept

* [X] Physical Layer: Full duplex unreliable wire
* [X] Physical Layer: Packet capture (.pcapng)
* [X] Link Layer: Ethernet
* [X] Link Layer: L2 Switch
* [X] Network Layer: IP/ARP
* [X] Network Layer: Router
* [X] Transport Layer: UDP
* [X] Transport Layer: TCP
* [X] Application Layer: TCP proxy
* [X] Application Layer: HTTP proxy

## Applications and hacks solving problems of the Network Layer

* [ ] DHCP
* [ ] DNS
* [ ] ICMP
* [ ] NAT (the hack)
* [ ] BGP
